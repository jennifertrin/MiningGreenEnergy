# Rewarding Miners for Green Practices
This proposal was originally created for the Green NFT Hackathon: Regen Sponsor Prize Bounty.

## The Problem

### Beyond Carbon Credits 

Though purchasing carbon credits offsets CO2 emissions, they do not prevent initial high emissions from NFT minting. Offering carbon credits for purchase might not lead to adoption while requiring carbon credits as part of NFT minting might deter the growth of NFTs. Creators, who alraedy struggle to earn a living due to high gas fees, cannot afford an additional $10 to $15 surcharge per NFT minted [1,2,3]. Instead of focusing only on carbon credits, we need sustainable miting options from the start. 

### Lack of data transparency

Creators and researchers disagree on early figures suggests that minting an NFT on Ethereum requires 35 kWh or 8,600 grams of CO2 due to the lack of verified and audited data on energy consumption and sources from minting. Much of the data focuses on energy consumption from the process of how blockchaind data is verified (ex. proof of stake vs. proof of work) while the sources from minting remains unclear.

Miners play an important role in reducing carbon emissions of the blockchain, and therefore, should receive incentives to make data transparent and for efforts for greener minting. Miners make critical decisions on the supply chain acquistion of infrastructure, property maintanence of facilities and surrounding land, and energy sources that fuel the mining.

## How It Would Work

Miners can join the Regen Network protocol to verify data on land restoration and supply chain, while the Regen Network protocol can provide REGEN tokens to contributing miners and supply the data to share with NFT marketplaces and specific blockchain community members.
